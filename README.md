  A data-driven model of nucleosynthesis with chemical tagging in latent space 
</h1>
<p align="center">
  Chemical tagging becomes a clustering problem if idealistic assumptions are made.
  However, there is information common to all stars: their chemical abundances are produced by the same nucleosynthetic processes, but in different relative quantities. 
  Here we use a mixture of factor analyzers to simultaneously estimate latent factors common to all stars (e.g., nucleosynthetic processes) and perform clustering (i.e., chemical tagging) in the latent space.
