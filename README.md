Mixture of common factor analysers
----------------------------------

An exact method for modelling multivariate data with orthonormal latent factors and soft clustering
in latent space. The clustering in latent space is performed by partial association of multivariate
normal distributions. Optimisation is performed by the expectation-maximization procedure outlined
by [Baek, McLachlan, and Flack, (2010)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5184847/).
